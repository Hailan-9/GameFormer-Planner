## Overview
This is an extension of [GameFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05760), focusing on a comprehensive planning framework for autonomous driving. The framework consists of four key steps: feature processing, path planning, model query, and trajectory refinement. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed planning framework, validating its effectiveness in both open-loop and closed-loop tests.
